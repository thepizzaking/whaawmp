Remake the Makefile (maybe)

Why isn't the thumbnailer picking up on .ogv files?

Make make.py platform independent (the chmod bit!)
Uninstall (maybe?)

Improve the 'tagType' function in mutagenTagger.py

Remove gobject.timeout_add_seconds for pre glib 2.14 systems when it becomes more widespread.
Replace current volume with a GTK volume widget (only available in 2.12, so should wait until it gets more widespread too)

Clean up __init__ and others
