Remake the Makefile (maybe)

Make make.py platform independent (the chmod bit!)
Uninstall (maybe?)

Fix the metadata thing somehow, currently disabled, it's **far** too slow with videos.
Using:
 import mutagen.[format]
metadata = mutagen.[format].Open(filename)
eg mutagen.oggtheora.Open(file) for ogv files etc.


Remove gobject.timeout_add_seconds for pre glib 2.14 systems when it becomes more widespread.
Replace current volume with a GTK volume widget (only available in 2.12, so should wait until it gets more widespread too)

Clean up __init__ and others
