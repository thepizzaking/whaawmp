Whaaw! Media Player installation instructions.
Written by Jeff Bailes.

Before you try to install or run Whaaw! Media Player you should check that you
have all the required dependencies, these include:
python >= 2.5
pygtk >= 2.10
gstreamer-python >= 0.10
pyxdg

I think that's about it (well, the ones I know about), the package names may
differ depending on your distribution, you will also need other gstreamer
packages depending on the type of media you wish to play.

Now, onto the building etc etc.
-To compile & install the files use ./make.py install
--There are --prefix and --root options (see ./make.py --help for more
information)
-If you're using checkinstall, I was having touble unless I used this command:
	'checkinstall ./make.py install --prefix=/usr'

eg. To install to /usr:
./make.py install --prefix=/usr


Also if you use a tool like checkinstall, I have added a Makefile which just
executes the correct commands for 'make' and 'make install'.  So it **should**
work, I haven't actually tested this though.

To run it afterwards, use whaawmp to start Whaaw! Media Player.

Any queries see the FAQ: http://home.gna.org/whaawmp/faq.html
