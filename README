Whaaw! Media Player installation instructions.
Written by Jeff Bailes.

Before you try to install or run Whaaw! Media Player you should check that you
have all the required dependencies, these include:
python >= 2.5
pygtk >= 2.10
gstreamer-python >= 0.10
gstreamer-good >= 0.10
pyxdg

Optional dependencies include:
dbus-python >= 0.80 ? (Not too sure about the version)

I think that's about it (well, the ones I know about), the package names may
differ depending on your distribution, you will also need other gstreamer
packages depending on the type of media you wish to play.

NOTE: Installation is not needed to use/test whaawmp.  It can be run fine by
just running './whaawmp.sh'.  Though if you really want to install it there
is an easy way to install it, but there's no easy way to uninstall.  See the
end of this file for a list of locations which files are installed to.

Now, onto the building etc etc.
-To compile & install the files use ./make.py install
--There are --prefix and --root options (see ./make.py --help for more
information)
-For checkinstall run: 'checkinstall ./make.py install'

eg. To install to /usr:
./make.py install --prefix=/usr

To run it afterwards, use whaawmp to start Whaaw! Media Player.

A list of files installed, and should be removed if uninstall is required:
(prefix=/usr by default)
${prefix}/bin/{whaawmp, whaaw-thumbnailer}
${prefix}/lib/python-${pyver}/site-packages/whaawmp-${whaaw-ver}-py${pyver}.egg-info
${prefix}/lib/python-${pyver}/site-packages/whaawmp (entire directory)
${prefix}/share/whaawmp.desktop
${prefix}/share/local/*/LC_MESSAGES/whaawmp.mo (list of languages in po dir)
${prefix}/share/pixmaps/whaawmp.svg
${prefix}/share/thumbnailers/whaaw-thumbnailer.desktop
${prefix}/share/whaawmp (entire directory)
